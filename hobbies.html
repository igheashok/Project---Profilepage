        </h2>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">
            So, you're wondering, "Can Coding Be A Hobby?". We'll let me be the first one to tell you that coding can
            definitely be a hobby and I have some great reasons to learn how to code.
        </p><br>
        <h4 class="left" style="color: rgb(113, 220, 255); font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 30px;"><em>How Can
                Coding Be A Hobby?</em></h4>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">
            For people who don't yet know how to code, it can be challenging to see how coding can be a hobby. However,
            there are a lot of different ways that people use code to fill both their social lives and personal time.
        </p><br>
        <h4 class="left" style="color: rgb(113, 220, 255); font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 30px;"><em>As A
                Form of Creation:</em></h4>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">At the end of the day, creating code
            is an art form. It is equally as creative as painting,
            drawing, making music, or any other creative skill.
        </p>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">With code, you can literally build
            anything you could ever imagine on a computer. The
            beautiful part about this hobby is that you can easily mix coding with any other hobby or pastime you enjoy
            doing.</p>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">Essentially I chosed Mechanical
            Engineering, but back then, I had no idea what am I
            interested in. But after a few years programming piqued my interest. So, I completed my Mechanical
            Engineering and started learning to code from scratch.</p><br>

    <!---------- Trading ---------->
    <div class="container"><br>
        <h2 class="left" style="color: darkturquoise; font-family: 'Cookie', cursive; font-size: 62px;">
            Trading
            <hr style="border-color: aliceblue;">
        </h2>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">
            Trading is a prime field for fortune hunters. Many people looking to make money enter the trading world with
            a hope of raking in profits. A large number of people take up trading full time and dive into it completely.
            I use trading as a side hustle, making money while having the security that a full-time job provides.
        </p>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">For a full-time trader, it takes a
            lot of time, but there are few trading forms and styles
            which don't require you to be around the computer all the time.</p>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">The style that suited me was long
            term trading. But even for this style of trading, it took a
            lot of attention and energy for the first few months. But learning how to trade was the need of the moment
            for my family. With enough curiosity, I started learning trading from the internet. I referred to multiple
            sources like Android apps, websites, e-books and free online courses. Within few months I had all the basic
            knowledge that was required to get me started.</p><br>
        <h4 class="left" style="color: rgb(97, 252, 255); font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 30px;"><em>Why I
                chosed trading?</em></h4>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">People turn to trading since trading
            has much greater profit potential than investing
            passively (aka value investing, which is generally considered a safer approach than trading). Trading allows
            you to increase your returns massively if you are willing to put in the effort, and thus people believe in
            their abilities to outperform the market.
            I cannot deny profit being the motivation for my learning, but that's not entirely true. For years I saw my
            uncle handling our finances, the curiosity to learn about trading grew ober time.

    <!---------- Reading ---------->
    <div class="container"><br>
        <h2 class="left" style="color: rgb(180, 59, 250); font-family: 'Cookie', cursive; font-size: 62px;">
            Reading
            <hr style="border-color: aliceblue;">
        </h2>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">One of my hobbies is reading. It was
            my like which turned to be my hobby in the long run.
            Each one of us has their favourite genre in music, movies etc. Likewise, my favourite genre in reading is
            self-help novels.</p>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">I have read many self-help novels
            written by Napoleon Hill, James Clear, Robin Sharma, Robert
            Green. The novel "The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind" by Joseph Murphy is my all time favourite. I
            have read
            this novel many times. I believe, one can never get the most out of a novel in a single read. Every time I
            read it, it got new insights from the book. Another of my favourite is the "5 AM Club" by Robin
            Sharma. I
            found the story portrayed in this novel more appealing than the concept of 5 AM club, LOL.</p><br>
        <h4 class="left" style="color: rgb(212, 138, 255); font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 30px;"><em>How
                reading helped me in my other hobbies?</em></h4>
        <p class="justify" style="font-family: 'Charm', cursive; font-size: 25px;">Reading helped me in learning how to
            code. I would purchase novels from the internet and I
            would go on a reading marathon. Be it reading late at night in my comfy bed or reading on a chilly morning
            while having breakfast or on an afternoon with a cup of coffee when it's raining outside. It also helped in
            staying on track with my trading hobby. I subscribed to multiple newsletters, bookmarked important Trading
            news sites and when I get some free time, I go through it all. </p><br>
